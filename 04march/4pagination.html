The  element is the root element of an HTML page
The element contains meta information about the HTML page
Theelement specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

                </p>
                <h1 id="c2">Chapter2</h1>
                <p>In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

                    Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

                    The visible part of the HTML document is between and The Declaration
                    The declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
                    
                    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
                    
                    The  declaration is not case sensitive.
